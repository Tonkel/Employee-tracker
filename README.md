# Employee-tracker

## Description
To use this software, clone this repo onto your local device, open up a terminal and run npmi. Then, login to mysql and run "source schema.sql" to create/use the database and create the tables in the database. Then, run "source seeds.sql" to seed the tables with data.
Next, open a terminal and run "node server" to start the server and connect to your localhost network. Next, open another terminal and run "node index". This will run the main file and allow you to access and manipulate the database based on prompts. I will attatch a video example below.
